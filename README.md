## Prerequisites

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Ensure you have Java installed. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

## Running the Application

To execute the EcoSim JAR file, download the pre-built JAR file from the [releases section](https://github.com/BRSY1/ecosim/releases):

**Using the Command Line**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `ecosim.jar`.
   - Run the following command:
     
     ```bash
     java -jar ecosim-1.0.0.jar
     ```
     
   - Ensure that the JAR file has execute permissions. If not, modify them using:
     
     ```bash
     chmod +x ecosim-1.0.0.jar
     ```
     
   - If double-clicking the JAR file doesn't launch the application, running it via the command line as shown above is recommended.
